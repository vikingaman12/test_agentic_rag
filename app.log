For this, the body is designed\nso that the brain sits inside a bony box. Inside the box, the brain is\ncontained in a fluid-filled balloon which provides further shock\nabsorption. If you run your hand down the middle of your back, you\nwill feel a hard, bumpy structure. This is the vertebral column or\nbackbone which protects the spinal cord.\n6.1.4 How does the Nervous Tissue cause Action?\nSo far , we have been talking about nervous tissue, and how it collects\ninformation, sends it around the body, processes information, makes\ndecisions based on information, and conveys decisions to muscles for\naction. In other words, when the action or movement is to be performed,\nmuscle tissue will do the final job. How do animal muscles move? When\na nerve impulse reaches the muscle, the muscle fibre must move. How\ndoes a muscle cell move? The simplest notion of movement at the cellular\nlevel is that muscle cells will move by changing their shape so that they\nshorten. So the next question is, how do muscle cells change their shape?\nThe answer must lie in the chemistry of cellular components. Muscle\ncells have special proteins that change both their shape and their\narrangement in the cell in response to nervous electrical impulses. When\nthis happens, new arrangements of these proteins give the muscle cells\na shorter form. Remember when we talked about muscle tissue in\nClass IX, there were different kinds of muscles, such as voluntary muscles\nand involuntary muscles. Based on what we have discussed so far , what\ndo you think the differences between these would be?\nQUESTIONS\n?1. What is the difference between a reflex action and walking?\n2. What happens at the synapse between two neurons?\n3. Which part of the brain maintains posture and equilibrium of the body?\n4. How do we detect the smell of an agarbatti (incense stick)?\n5. What is the role of the brain in reflex action?\n6.2 COORDINA6.2 COORDINA6.2 COORDINA6.2 COORDINA6.2 COORDINA TION IN PLTION IN PLTION IN PLTION IN PLTION IN PL ANTSANTSANTS\nANTSANTS\nAnimals have a nervous system for controlling and coordinating the\nactivities of the body. But plants have neither a nervous system nor\nmuscles. So, how do they respond to stimuli? When we touch the leaves\nof a chhui-mui  (the ‘sensitive’ or ‘touch-me-not’ plant of the Mimosa\nfamily), they begin to fold up and droop. When a seed germinates, the\nroot goes down, the stem comes up into the air . What happens? Firstly,\nthe leaves of the sensitive plant move very quickly in response to touch.\n2024-25\n\n\nSource: chapter_6.pdf (Page 2)\nContent: Control and Coordination 101object is an urgent and dangerous\nsituation for us. W e need to detect it,\nand respond to it. How do we detect that\nwe are touching a hot object? All\ninformation from our environment is\ndetected by the specialised tips of some\nnerve cells. These receptors are usually\nlocated in our sense organs, such as the\ninner ear , the nose, the tongue, and so\non. So gustatory receptors will detect taste\nwhile olfactory receptors will detect smell.\nThis information, acquired at the\nend of the dendritic tip of a nerve cell\n[Fig. 6.1 (a)],  sets off a chemical reaction\nthat creates an electrical impulse. This\nimpulse travels from the dendrite to the\ncell body, and then along the axon to its\nend. At the end of the axon, the electrical\nimpulse sets off the release of some\nchemicals. These chemicals cross the\ngap, or synapse, and start a similar\nelectrical impulse in a dendrite of the next\nneuron. This is a general scheme of how\nnervous impulses travel in the body. A\nsimilar synapse finally allows delivery of such impulses from neurons to\nother cells, such as muscles cells or gland  [Fig. 6.1 (b)].\nIt is thus no surprise that nervous tissue is made up of an organised\nnetwork of nerve cells or neurons, and is specialised for conducting\ninformation via electrical impulses fr om one part of the body to another .\nLook at Fig. 6.1 (a) and identify the parts of a neuron (i) where\ninformation is acquired, (ii) through which information travels as an\nelectrical impulse, and (iii) where this impulse must be converted into a\nchemical signal for onward transmi ssion.\nActivity 6.1Activity 6.1Activity 6.1Activity 6.1Activity 6.1\n/square6Put some sugar in your mouth.

Is ther e any dif ference in its taste?\n/square6While eating lunch, block your nose in the same way and notice if\nyou can fully appreciate the taste of the food you are eating.\nIs there a difference in how sugar and food taste if your nose is\nblocked? If so, why might this be happening? Read and talk about\npossible explanations for these kinds of differences. Do you come across\na similar situation when you have a cold?\nFigure 6.1 Figure 6.1 Figure 6.1 Figure 6.1 Figure 6.1 (a) Structure of neuron, (b)      Neuromuscular\njunction(a)\n(b)\n2024-25\n\n\nSource: chapter_6.pdf (Page 3)\nContent: Science 1026.1.1 What happens in Reflex Actions?\n‘Reflex’ is a word we use very commonly when we talk about some sudden\naction in r esponse to something in the envir onment. W e say ‘I jumped\nout of the way of the bus reflexly’, or ‘I pulled my hand back from the\nflame reflexly’, or ‘I was so hungry my mouth started watering reflexly’.\nWhat exactly do we mean? A common idea in all such examples is that\nwe do something without thinking about it, or without feeling in control\nof our r eactions. Y et these ar e situations wher e we ar e responding with\nsome action to changes in our environment. How is control and\ncoordination achieved in such situations?\nLet us consider this further . Take one of our examples. T\nouching a\nflame is an urgent and dangerous situation for us, or in fact, for any\nanimal! How would we respond to this? One seemingly simple way is to\nthink consciously about the pain and the possibility of getting burnt,\nand therefore move our hand. An important question then is, how long\nwill it take us to think all this? The answer depends on how we think.  If\nnerve impulses ar e sent ar ound the way we have talked about earlier ,\nthen thinking is also likely to involve the creation of such impulses.\nThinking is a complex activity, so it is bound to involve a complicated\ninteraction of many nerve impulses from many neurons.\nIf this is the case, it is no surprise that the thinking tissue in our\nbody consists of dense networks of intricately arranged neurons. It sits\nin the forward end of the skull, and receives signals from all over the\nbody which it thinks about before responding to them. Obviously, in\norder to receive these signals, this thinking part of the brain in the skull\nmust be connected to nerves coming from various parts of the body.\nSimilarly, if this part of the brain is to instruct muscles to move, nerves\nmust carry this signal back to different parts of the body. If all of this is\nto be done when we touch a hot object, it may take enough time for us to\nget burnt!\nHow does the design of the body solve this problem? Rather than\nhaving to think about the sensation of heat, if the nerves that detect heat\nwere to be connected to the nerves that move muscles in a simpler way,\nthe process of detecting the signal or the input and responding to it by\nan output action might be completed quickly. Such a connection is\ncommonly called a reflex arc (Fig. 6.2). Where should such reflex arc\nconnections be made between the input nerve and the output nerve?\nThe best place, of course, would be at the point where they first meet\neach other . Nerves fr om all over the body meet in a bundle in the spinal\ncord on their way to the brain. Reflex arcs are formed in this spinal cord\nitself, although the information input also goes on to reach the brain.\nOf course, reflex arcs have evolved in animals because the thinking\nprocess of the brain is not fast enough.  In fact many animals have very\nlittle or none of the complex neuron network needed for thinking. So it is\nquite likely that reflex arcs have evolved as efficient ways of functioning\nin the absence of true thought pr ocesses.  However , even after complex\nneuron networks have come into existence, reflex arcs continue to be\nmore efficient for quick responses.\n2024-25\n\n\nSource: chapter_6.pdf (Page 1)\nContent: Science 100Control and\nCoordination6 CHAPTER\nIn the pr evious chapter , we looked at life pr ocesses involved in the\nmaintenance functions in living organisms. There, we had started with\na notion we all have, that if we see something moving, it is alive. Some of\nthese movements are in fact the result of growth, as in plants. A seed\ngerminates and grows, and we can see that the seedling moves over the\ncourse of a few days, it pushes soil aside and comes out. But if its growth\nwere to be stopped, these movements would not happen. Some\nmovements, as in many animals and some plants, are not connected\nwith growth. A cat running, children playing on swings, buffaloes\nchewing cud – these are not movements caused by growth.\nWhy do we associate such visible movements with life? A possible\nanswer is that we think of movement as a response to a change in the\nenvironment of the organism. The cat may be running because it has\nseen a mouse.  Not only that, we also think of movement as an attempt\nby living organisms to use changes in their environment to their\nadvantage. Plants grow out into the sunshine. Children try to get pleasure\nand fun out of swinging. Buffaloes chew cud to help break up tough\nfood so as to be able to digest it better . When bright light is focussed on\nour eyes or when we touch a hot object, we detect the change and respond\nto it with movement in order to protect ourselves.\nIf we think a bit more about this, it becomes apparent that all this\nmovement, in response to the environment, is carefully controlled. Each\nkind of a change in the environment evokes an appropriate movement\nin response. When we want to talk to our friends in class, we whisper ,\nrather than shouting loudly. Clearly, the movement to be made depends\non the event that is triggering it. Therefore, such controlled movement\nmust be connected to the recognition of various events in the\nenvironment, followed by only the correct movement in response. In other\nwords, living organisms must use systems providing control and\ncoordination. In keeping with the general principles of body organisation\nin multicellular organisms, specialised tissues are used to provide these\ncontrol and coordination activities.\n6.1\n6.16.1 6.16.1ANIMALS – NERVOUS SYSTEMANIMALS – NERVOUS SYSTEMANIMALS – NERVOUS SYSTEMANIMALS – NERVOUS SYSTEMANIMALS – NERVOUS SYSTEM\nIn animals, such control and coordination are provided by nervous and\nmuscular tissues, which we have studied  in Class IX.

Obviously not, since\nwe know that we are thinking beings. Spinal cord is made up of nerves\nwhich supply information to think about. Thinking involves more\ncomplex mechanisms and neural connections. These are concentrated\nin the brain, which is the main coordinating centre of the body.  The\nbrain and spinal cord constitute the central nervous system (Fig. 6.3).\nThey receive information from all parts of the body and integrate it.\nWe also think about our actions. W riting, talking, moving a chair ,\nclapping at the end of a programme are examples of voluntary actions\nwhich are based on deciding what to do next.  So, the brain also has to\nsend messages to muscles.  This is the second way in which the nervous\nsystem communicates with the muscles.  The communication between\nthe central nervous system and the other parts of the body is facilitated\nby the peripheral nervous system consisting of cranial nerves arising\nfrom the brain and spinal nerves arising from the spinal cord. The brain\nthus allows us to think and take actions based on that thinking.  As you\nwill expect, this is accomplished through a complex design, with different\nparts of the brain responsible for integrating different inputs and outputs.\nThe brain has three such major parts or regions, namely the fore-brain,\nmid-brain and hind-brain.\nThe fore-brain is the main thinking part of the brain. It has regions\nwhich receive sensory impulses from various receptors. Separate areas\nof the fore-brain are specialised for hearing, smell, sight and so on.  There\nare separate areas of association where this sensory information is\ninterpreted by putting it together with information from other receptors\nas well as with information that is already stored in the brain.

For this, the body is designed\nso that the brain sits inside a bony box. Inside the box, the brain is\ncontained in a fluid-filled balloon which provides further shock\nabsorption. If you run your hand down the middle of your back, you\nwill feel a hard, bumpy structure. This is the vertebral column or\nbackbone which protects the spinal cord.\n6.1.4 How does the Nervous Tissue cause Action?\nSo far , we have been talking about nervous tissue, and how it collects\ninformation, sends it around the body, processes information, makes\ndecisions based on information, and conveys decisions to muscles for\naction. In other words, when the action or movement is to be performed,\nmuscle tissue will do the final job. How do animal muscles move? When\na nerve impulse reaches the muscle, the muscle fibre must move. How\ndoes a muscle cell move? The simplest notion of movement at the cellular\nlevel is that muscle cells will move by changing their shape so that they\nshorten. So the next question is, how do muscle cells change their shape?\nThe answer must lie in the chemistry of cellular components. Muscle\ncells have special proteins that change both their shape and their\narrangement in the cell in response to nervous electrical impulses. When\nthis happens, new arrangements of these proteins give the muscle cells\na shorter form. Remember when we talked about muscle tissue in\nClass IX, there were different kinds of muscles, such as voluntary muscles\nand involuntary muscles. Based on what we have discussed so far , what\ndo you think the differences between these would be?\nQUESTIONS\n?1. What is the difference between a reflex action and walking?\n2. What happens at the synapse between two neurons?\n3. Which part of the brain maintains posture and equilibrium of the body?\n4. How do we detect the smell of an agarbatti (incense stick)?\n5. What is the role of the brain in reflex action?\n6.2 COORDINA6.2 COORDINA6.2 COORDINA6.2 COORDINA6.2 COORDINA TION IN PLTION IN PLTION IN PLTION IN PLTION IN PL ANTSANTSANTS\nANTSANTS\nAnimals have a nervous system for controlling and coordinating the\nactivities of the body. But plants have neither a nervous system nor\nmuscles. So, how do they respond to stimuli? When we touch the leaves\nof a chhui-mui  (the ‘sensitive’ or ‘touch-me-not’ plant of the Mimosa\nfamily), they begin to fold up and droop. When a seed germinates, the\nroot goes down, the stem comes up into the air . What happens? Firstly,\nthe leaves of the sensitive plant move very quickly in response to touch.\n2024-25\n\n\nSource: chapter_6.pdf (Page 2)\nContent: Control and Coordination 101object is an urgent and dangerous\nsituation for us. W e need to detect it,\nand respond to it. How do we detect that\nwe are touching a hot object? All\ninformation from our environment is\ndetected by the specialised tips of some\nnerve cells. These receptors are usually\nlocated in our sense organs, such as the\ninner ear , the nose, the tongue, and so\non. So gustatory receptors will detect taste\nwhile olfactory receptors will detect smell.\nThis information, acquired at the\nend of the dendritic tip of a nerve cell\n[Fig. 6.1 (a)],  sets off a chemical reaction\nthat creates an electrical impulse. This\nimpulse travels from the dendrite to the\ncell body, and then along the axon to its\nend. At the end of the axon, the electrical\nimpulse sets off the release of some\nchemicals. These chemicals cross the\ngap, or synapse, and start a similar\nelectrical impulse in a dendrite of the next\nneuron. This is a general scheme of how\nnervous impulses travel in the body. A\nsimilar synapse finally allows delivery of such impulses from neurons to\nother cells, such as muscles cells or gland  [Fig. 6.1 (b)].\nIt is thus no surprise that nervous tissue is made up of an organised\nnetwork of nerve cells or neurons, and is specialised for conducting\ninformation via electrical impulses fr om one part of the body to another .\nLook at Fig. 6.1 (a) and identify the parts of a neuron (i) where\ninformation is acquired, (ii) through which information travels as an\nelectrical impulse, and (iii) where this impulse must be converted into a\nchemical signal for onward transmi ssion.\nActivity 6.1Activity 6.1Activity 6.1Activity 6.1Activity 6.1\n/square6Put some sugar in your mouth.

If so, why might this be happening? Read and talk about\npossible explanations for these kinds of differences. Do you come across\na similar situation when you have a cold?\nFigure 6.1 Figure 6.1 Figure 6.1 Figure 6.1 Figure 6.1 (a) Structure of neuron, (b)      Neuromuscular\njunction(a)\n(b)\n2024-25\n\n\nSource: chapter_6.pdf (Page 3)\nContent: Science 1026.1.1 What happens in Reflex Actions?\n‘Reflex’ is a word we use very commonly when we talk about some sudden\naction in r esponse to something in the envir onment. W e say ‘I jumped\nout of the way of the bus reflexly’, or ‘I pulled my hand back from the\nflame reflexly’, or ‘I was so hungry my mouth started watering reflexly’.\nWhat exactly do we mean? A common idea in all such examples is that\nwe do something without thinking about it, or without feeling in control\nof our r eactions. Y et these ar e situations wher e we ar e responding with\nsome action to changes in our environment. How is control and\ncoordination achieved in such situations?\nLet us consider this further . Take one of our examples. T\nouching a\nflame is an urgent and dangerous situation for us, or in fact, for any\nanimal! How would we respond to this? One seemingly simple way is to\nthink consciously about the pain and the possibility of getting burnt,\nand therefore move our hand. An important question then is, how long\nwill it take us to think all this? The answer depends on how we think.  If\nnerve impulses ar e sent ar ound the way we have talked about earlier ,\nthen thinking is also likely to involve the creation of such impulses.\nThinking is a complex activity, so it is bound to involve a complicated\ninteraction of many nerve impulses from many neurons.\nIf this is the case, it is no surprise that the thinking tissue in our\nbody consists of dense networks of intricately arranged neurons. It sits\nin the forward end of the skull, and receives signals from all over the\nbody which it thinks about before responding to them. Obviously, in\norder to receive these signals, this thinking part of the brain in the skull\nmust be connected to nerves coming from various parts of the body.\nSimilarly, if this part of the brain is to instruct muscles to move, nerves\nmust carry this signal back to different parts of the body. If all of this is\nto be done when we touch a hot object, it may take enough time for us to\nget burnt!\nHow does the design of the body solve this problem? Rather than\nhaving to think about the sensation of heat, if the nerves that detect heat\nwere to be connected to the nerves that move muscles in a simpler way,\nthe process of detecting the signal or the input and responding to it by\nan output action might be completed quickly. Such a connection is\ncommonly called a reflex arc (Fig. 6.2). Where should such reflex arc\nconnections be made between the input nerve and the output nerve?\nThe best place, of course, would be at the point where they first meet\neach other . Nerves fr om all over the body meet in a bundle in the spinal\ncord on their way to the brain. Reflex arcs are formed in this spinal cord\nitself, although the information input also goes on to reach the brain.\nOf course, reflex arcs have evolved in animals because the thinking\nprocess of the brain is not fast enough.

So it is\nquite likely that reflex arcs have evolved as efficient ways of functioning\nin the absence of true thought pr ocesses.  However , even after complex\nneuron networks have come into existence, reflex arcs continue to be\nmore efficient for quick responses.\n2024-25\n\n\nSource: chapter_6.pdf (Page 1)\nContent: Science 100Control and\nCoordination6 CHAPTER\nIn the pr evious chapter , we looked at life pr ocesses involved in the\nmaintenance functions in living organisms.

For this, the body is designed\nso that the brain sits inside a bony box. Inside the box, the brain is\ncontained in a fluid-filled balloon which provides further shock\nabsorption. If you run your hand down the middle of your back, you\nwill feel a hard, bumpy structure. This is the vertebral column or\nbackbone which protects the spinal cord.\n6.1.4 How does the Nervous Tissue cause Action?\nSo far , we have been talking about nervous tissue, and how it collects\ninformation, sends it around the body, processes information, makes\ndecisions based on information, and conveys decisions to muscles for\naction. In other words, when the action or movement is to be performed,\nmuscle tissue will do the final job. How do animal muscles move? When\na nerve impulse reaches the muscle, the muscle fibre must move. How\ndoes a muscle cell move? The simplest notion of movement at the cellular\nlevel is that muscle cells will move by changing their shape so that they\nshorten. So the next question is, how do muscle cells change their shape?\nThe answer must lie in the chemistry of cellular components. Muscle\ncells have special proteins that change both their shape and their\narrangement in the cell in response to nervous electrical impulses. When\nthis happens, new arrangements of these proteins give the muscle cells\na shorter form. Remember when we talked about muscle tissue in\nClass IX, there were different kinds of muscles, such as voluntary muscles\nand involuntary muscles. Based on what we have discussed so far , what\ndo you think the differences between these would be?\nQUESTIONS\n?1. What is the difference between a reflex action and walking?\n2. What happens at the synapse between two neurons?\n3. Which part of the brain maintains posture and equilibrium of the body?\n4. How do we detect the smell of an agarbatti (incense stick)?\n5.

But plants have neither a nervous system nor\nmuscles. So, how do they respond to stimuli? When we touch the leaves\nof a chhui-mui  (the ‘sensitive’ or ‘touch-me-not’ plant of the Mimosa\nfamily), they begin to fold up and droop. When a seed germinates, the\nroot goes down, the stem comes up into the air . What happens? Firstly,\nthe leaves of the sensitive plant move very quickly in response to touch.\n2024-25\n\n\nSource: chapter_6.pdf (Page 2)\nContent: Control and Coordination 101object is an urgent and dangerous\nsituation for us. W e need to detect it,\nand respond to it. How do we detect that\nwe are touching a hot object? All\ninformation from our environment is\ndetected by the specialised tips of some\nnerve cells. These receptors are usually\nlocated in our sense organs, such as the\ninner ear , the nose, the tongue, and so\non. So gustatory receptors will detect taste\nwhile olfactory receptors will detect smell.\nThis information, acquired at the\nend of the dendritic tip of a nerve cell\n[Fig. 6.1 (a)],  sets off a chemical reaction\nthat creates an electrical impulse. This\nimpulse travels from the dendrite to the\ncell body, and then along the axon to its\nend. At the end of the axon, the electrical\nimpulse sets off the release of some\nchemicals. These chemicals cross the\ngap, or synapse, and start a similar\nelectrical impulse in a dendrite of the next\nneuron. This is a general scheme of how\nnervous impulses travel in the body. A\nsimilar synapse finally allows delivery of such impulses from neurons to\nother cells, such as muscles cells or gland  [Fig. 6.1 (b)].\nIt is thus no surprise that nervous tissue is made up of an organised\nnetwork of nerve cells or neurons, and is specialised for conducting\ninformation via electrical impulses fr om one part of the body to another .\nLook at Fig. 6.1 (a) and identify the parts of a neuron (i) where\ninformation is acquired, (ii) through which information travels as an\nelectrical impulse, and (iii) where this impulse must be converted into a\nchemical signal for onward transmi ssion.\nActivity 6.1Activity 6.1Activity 6.1Activity 6.1Activity 6.1\n/square6Put some sugar in your mouth.

W e say ‘I jumped\nout of the way of the bus reflexly’, or ‘I pulled my hand back from the\nflame reflexly’, or ‘I was so hungry my mouth started watering reflexly’.\nWhat exactly do we mean? A common idea in all such examples is that\nwe do something without thinking about it, or without feeling in control\nof our r eactions. Y et these ar e situations wher e we ar e responding with\nsome action to changes in our environment. How is control and\ncoordination achieved in such situations?\nLet us consider this further . Take one of our examples. T\nouching a\nflame is an urgent and dangerous situation for us, or in fact, for any\nanimal! How would we respond to this? One seemingly simple way is to\nthink consciously about the pain and the possibility of getting burnt,\nand therefore move our hand. An important question then is, how long\nwill it take us to think all this? The answer depends on how we think.  If\nnerve impulses ar e sent ar ound the way we have talked about earlier ,\nthen thinking is also likely to involve the creation of such impulses.\nThinking is a complex activity, so it is bound to involve a complicated\ninteraction of many nerve impulses from many neurons.\nIf this is the case, it is no surprise that the thinking tissue in our\nbody consists of dense networks of intricately arranged neurons. It sits\nin the forward end of the skull, and receives signals from all over the\nbody which it thinks about before responding to them. Obviously, in\norder to receive these signals, this thinking part of the brain in the skull\nmust be connected to nerves coming from various parts of the body.\nSimilarly, if this part of the brain is to instruct muscles to move, nerves\nmust carry this signal back to different parts of the body. If all of this is\nto be done when we touch a hot object, it may take enough time for us to\nget burnt!\nHow does the design of the body solve this problem? Rather than\nhaving to think about the sensation of heat, if the nerves that detect heat\nwere to be connected to the nerves that move muscles in a simpler way,\nthe process of detecting the signal or the input and responding to it by\nan output action might be completed quickly. Such a connection is\ncommonly called a reflex arc (Fig. 6.2). Where should such reflex arc\nconnections be made between the input nerve and the output nerve?\nThe best place, of course, would be at the point where they first meet\neach other . Nerves fr om all over the body meet in a bundle in the spinal\ncord on their way to the brain. Reflex arcs are formed in this spinal cord\nitself, although the information input also goes on to reach the brain.\nOf course, reflex arcs have evolved in animals because the thinking\nprocess of the brain is not fast enough.  In fact many animals have very\nlittle or none of the complex neuron network needed for thinking. So it is\nquite likely that reflex arcs have evolved as efficient ways of functioning\nin the absence of true thought pr ocesses.  However , even after complex\nneuron networks have come into existence, reflex arcs continue to be\nmore efficient for quick responses.\n2024-25\n\n\nSource: chapter_6.pdf (Page 1)\nContent: Science 100Control and\nCoordination6 CHAPTER\nIn the pr evious chapter , we looked at life pr ocesses involved in the\nmaintenance functions in living organisms. There, we had started with\na notion we all have, that if we see something moving, it is alive. Some of\nthese movements are in fact the result of growth, as in plants. A seed\ngerminates and grows, and we can see that the seedling moves over the\ncourse of a few days, it pushes soil aside and comes out. But if its growth\nwere to be stopped, these movements would not happen. Some\nmovements, as in many animals and some plants, are not connected\nwith growth. A cat running, children playing on swings, buffaloes\nchewing cud – these are not movements caused by growth.\nWhy do we associate such visible movements with life? A possible\nanswer is that we think of movement as a response to a change in the\nenvironment of the organism. The cat may be running because it has\nseen a mouse.  Not only that, we also think of movement as an attempt\nby living organisms to use changes in their environment to their\nadvantage. Plants grow out into the sunshine. Children try to get pleasure\nand fun out of swinging. Buffaloes chew cud to help break up tough\nfood so as to be able to digest it better . When bright light is focussed on\nour eyes or when we touch a hot object, we detect the change and respond\nto it with movement in order to protect ourselves.\nIf we think a bit more about this, it becomes apparent that all this\nmovement, in response to the environment, is carefully controlled. Each\nkind of a change in the environment evokes an appropriate movement\nin response. When we want to talk to our friends in class, we whisper ,\nrather than shouting loudly. Clearly, the movement to be made depends\non the event that is triggering it. Therefore, such controlled movement\nmust be connected to the recognition of various events in the\nenvironment, followed by only the correct movement in response. In other\nwords, living organisms must use systems providing control and\ncoordination. In keeping with the general principles of body organisation\nin multicellular organisms, specialised tissues are used to provide these\ncontrol and coordination activities.\n6.1\n6.16.1 6.16.1ANIMALS – NERVOUS SYSTEMANIMALS – NERVOUS SYSTEMANIMALS – NERVOUS SYSTEMANIMALS – NERVOUS SYSTEMANIMALS – NERVOUS SYSTEM\nIn animals, such control and coordination are provided by nervous and\nmuscular tissues, which we have studied  in Class IX. Touching a hot\n2024-25\n\n\nSource: chapter_6.pdf (Page 4)\nContent: Control and Coordination 103Can you now trace the sequence of events which occur when a bright\nlight is focussed on your eyes?\n6.1.2 Human Brain\nIs reflex action the only function of the spinal cord? Obviously not, since\nwe know that we are thinking beings. Spinal cord is made up of nerves\nwhich supply information to think about. Thinking involves more\ncomplex mechanisms and neural connections. These are concentrated\nin the brain, which is the main coordinating centre of the body.  The\nbrain and spinal cord constitute the central nervous system (Fig. 6.3).\nThey receive information from all parts of the body and integrate it.\nWe also think about our actions. W riting, talking, moving a chair ,\nclapping at the end of a programme are examples of voluntary actions\nwhich are based on deciding what to do next.  So, the brain also has to\nsend messages to muscles.  This is the second way in which the nervous\nsystem communicates with the muscles.  The communication between\nthe central nervous system and the other parts of the body is facilitated\nby the peripheral nervous system consisting of cranial nerves arising\nfrom the brain and spinal nerves arising from the spinal cord. The brain\nthus allows us to think and take actions based on that thinking.  As you\nwill expect, this is accomplished through a complex design, with different\nparts of the brain responsible for integrating different inputs and outputs.\nThe brain has three such major parts or regions, namely the fore-brain,\nmid-brain and hind-brain.\nThe fore-brain is the main thinking part of the brain. It has regions\nwhich receive sensory impulses from various receptors. Separate areas\nof the fore-brain are specialised for hearing, smell, sight and so on.  There\nare separate areas of association where this sensory information is\ninterpreted by putting it together with information from other receptors\nas well as with information that is already stored in the brain.

However , even after complex\nneuron networks have come into existence, reflex arcs continue to be\nmore efficient for quick responses.\n2024-25\n\n\nSource: chapter_6.pdf (Page 1)\nContent: Science 100Control and\nCoordination6 CHAPTER\nIn the pr evious chapter , we looked at life pr ocesses involved in the\nmaintenance functions in living organisms. There, we had started with\na notion we all have, that if we see something moving, it is alive. Some of\nthese movements are in fact the result of growth, as in plants. A seed\ngerminates and grows, and we can see that the seedling moves over the\ncourse of a few days, it pushes soil aside and comes out. But if its growth\nwere to be stopped, these movements would not happen. Some\nmovements, as in many animals and some plants, are not connected\nwith growth. A cat running, children playing on swings, buffaloes\nchewing cud – these are not movements caused by growth.\nWhy do we associate such visible movements with life? A possible\nanswer is that we think of movement as a response to a change in the\nenvironment of the organism. The cat may be running because it has\nseen a mouse.  Not only that, we also think of movement as an attempt\nby living organisms to use changes in their environment to their\nadvantage. Plants grow out into the sunshine. Children try to get pleasure\nand fun out of swinging. Buffaloes chew cud to help break up tough\nfood so as to be able to digest it better . When bright light is focussed on\nour eyes or when we touch a hot object, we detect the change and respond\nto it with movement in order to protect ourselves.\nIf we think a bit more about this, it becomes apparent that all this\nmovement, in response to the environment, is carefully controlled. Each\nkind of a change in the environment evokes an appropriate movement\nin response. When we want to talk to our friends in class, we whisper ,\nrather than shouting loudly. Clearly, the movement to be made depends\non the event that is triggering it. Therefore, such controlled movement\nmust be connected to the recognition of various events in the\nenvironment, followed by only the correct movement in response. In other\nwords, living organisms must use systems providing control and\ncoordination. In keeping with the general principles of body organisation\nin multicellular organisms, specialised tissues are used to provide these\ncontrol and coordination activities.\n6.1\n6.16.1 6.16.1ANIMALS – NERVOUS SYSTEMANIMALS – NERVOUS SYSTEMANIMALS – NERVOUS SYSTEMANIMALS – NERVOUS SYSTEMANIMALS – NERVOUS SYSTEM\nIn animals, such control and coordination are provided by nervous and\nmuscular tissues, which we have studied  in Class IX.

Obviously not, since\nwe know that we are thinking beings. Spinal cord is made up of nerves\nwhich supply information to think about. Thinking involves more\ncomplex mechanisms and neural connections. These are concentrated\nin the brain, which is the main coordinating centre of the body.  The\nbrain and spinal cord constitute the central nervous system (Fig. 6.3).\nThey receive information from all parts of the body and integrate it.\nWe also think about our actions. W riting, talking, moving a chair ,\nclapping at the end of a programme are examples of voluntary actions\nwhich are based on deciding what to do next.  So, the brain also has to\nsend messages to muscles.  This is the second way in which the nervous\nsystem communicates with the muscles.  The communication between\nthe central nervous system and the other parts of the body is facilitated\nby the peripheral nervous system consisting of cranial nerves arising\nfrom the brain and spinal nerves arising from the spinal cord. The brain\nthus allows us to think and take actions based on that thinking.  As you\nwill expect, this is accomplished through a complex design, with different\nparts of the brain responsible for integrating different inputs and outputs.\nThe brain has three such major parts or regions, namely the fore-brain,\nmid-brain and hind-brain.\nThe fore-brain is the main thinking part of the brain. It has regions\nwhich receive sensory impulses from various receptors. Separate areas\nof the fore-brain are specialised for hearing, smell, sight and so on.  There\nare separate areas of association where this sensory information is\ninterpreted by putting it together with information from other receptors\nas well as with information that is already stored in the brain.

For this, the body is designed\nso that the brain sits inside a bony box. Inside the box, the brain is\ncontained in a fluid-filled balloon which provides further shock\nabsorption. If you run your hand down the middle of your back, you\nwill feel a hard, bumpy structure. This is the vertebral column or\nbackbone which protects the spinal cord.\n6.1.4 How does the Nervous Tissue cause Action?\nSo far , we have been talking about nervous tissue, and how it collects\ninformation, sends it around the body, processes information, makes\ndecisions based on information, and conveys decisions to muscles for\naction. In other words, when the action or movement is to be performed,\nmuscle tissue will do the final job. How do animal muscles move? When\na nerve impulse reaches the muscle, the muscle fibre must move. How\ndoes a muscle cell move? The simplest notion of movement at the cellular\nlevel is that muscle cells will move by changing their shape so that they\nshorten. So the next question is, how do muscle cells change their shape?\nThe answer must lie in the chemistry of cellular components. Muscle\ncells have special proteins that change both their shape and their\narrangement in the cell in response to nervous electrical impulses. When\nthis happens, new arrangements of these proteins give the muscle cells\na shorter form. Remember when we talked about muscle tissue in\nClass IX, there were different kinds of muscles, such as voluntary muscles\nand involuntary muscles. Based on what we have discussed so far , what\ndo you think the differences between these would be?\nQUESTIONS\n?1. What is the difference between a reflex action and walking?\n2. What happens at the synapse between two neurons?\n3. Which part of the brain maintains posture and equilibrium of the body?\n4. How do we detect the smell of an agarbatti (incense stick)?\n5. What is the role of the brain in reflex action?\n6.2 COORDINA6.2 COORDINA6.2 COORDINA6.2 COORDINA6.2 COORDINA TION IN PLTION IN PLTION IN PLTION IN PLTION IN PL ANTSANTSANTS\nANTSANTS\nAnimals have a nervous system for controlling and coordinating the\nactivities of the body. But plants have neither a nervous system nor\nmuscles. So, how do they respond to stimuli? When we touch the leaves\nof a chhui-mui  (the ‘sensitive’ or ‘touch-me-not’ plant of the Mimosa\nfamily), they begin to fold up and droop. When a seed germinates, the\nroot goes down, the stem comes up into the air . What happens? Firstly,\nthe leaves of the sensitive plant move very quickly in response to touch.\n2024-25\n\n\nSource: chapter_6.pdf (Page 2)\nContent: Control and Coordination 101object is an urgent and dangerous\nsituation for us. W e need to detect it,\nand respond to it. How do we detect that\nwe are touching a hot object? All\ninformation from our environment is\ndetected by the specialised tips of some\nnerve cells. These receptors are usually\nlocated in our sense organs, such as the\ninner ear , the nose, the tongue, and so\non. So gustatory receptors will detect taste\nwhile olfactory receptors will detect smell.\nThis information, acquired at the\nend of the dendritic tip of a nerve cell\n[Fig. 6.1 (a)],  sets off a chemical reaction\nthat creates an electrical impulse. This\nimpulse travels from the dendrite to the\ncell body, and then along the axon to its\nend. At the end of the axon, the electrical\nimpulse sets off the release of some\nchemicals. These chemicals cross the\ngap, or synapse, and start a similar\nelectrical impulse in a dendrite of the next\nneuron. This is a general scheme of how\nnervous impulses travel in the body. A\nsimilar synapse finally allows delivery of such impulses from neurons to\nother cells, such as muscles cells or gland  [Fig. 6.1 (b)].\nIt is thus no surprise that nervous tissue is made up of an organised\nnetwork of nerve cells or neurons, and is specialised for conducting\ninformation via electrical impulses fr om one part of the body to another .\nLook at Fig. 6.1 (a) and identify the parts of a neuron (i) where\ninformation is acquired, (ii) through which information travels as an\nelectrical impulse, and (iii) where this impulse must be converted into a\nchemical signal for onward transmi ssion.\nActivity 6.1Activity 6.1Activity 6.1Activity 6.1Activity 6.1\n/square6Put some sugar in your mouth.

W e say ‘I jumped\nout of the way of the bus reflexly’, or ‘I pulled my hand back from the\nflame reflexly’, or ‘I was so hungry my mouth started watering reflexly’.\nWhat exactly do we mean? A common idea in all such examples is that\nwe do something without thinking about it, or without feeling in control\nof our r eactions. Y et these ar e situations wher e we ar e responding with\nsome action to changes in our environment. How is control and\ncoordination achieved in such situations?\nLet us consider this further . Take one of our examples. T\nouching a\nflame is an urgent and dangerous situation for us, or in fact, for any\nanimal! How would we respond to this? One seemingly simple way is to\nthink consciously about the pain and the possibility of getting burnt,\nand therefore move our hand. An important question then is, how long\nwill it take us to think all this? The answer depends on how we think.  If\nnerve impulses ar e sent ar ound the way we have talked about earlier ,\nthen thinking is also likely to involve the creation of such impulses.\nThinking is a complex activity, so it is bound to involve a complicated\ninteraction of many nerve impulses from many neurons.\nIf this is the case, it is no surprise that the thinking tissue in our\nbody consists of dense networks of intricately arranged neurons. It sits\nin the forward end of the skull, and receives signals from all over the\nbody which it thinks about before responding to them. Obviously, in\norder to receive these signals, this thinking part of the brain in the skull\nmust be connected to nerves coming from various parts of the body.\nSimilarly, if this part of the brain is to instruct muscles to move, nerves\nmust carry this signal back to different parts of the body. If all of this is\nto be done when we touch a hot object, it may take enough time for us to\nget burnt!\nHow does the design of the body solve this problem? Rather than\nhaving to think about the sensation of heat, if the nerves that detect heat\nwere to be connected to the nerves that move muscles in a simpler way,\nthe process of detecting the signal or the input and responding to it by\nan output action might be completed quickly. Such a connection is\ncommonly called a reflex arc (Fig. 6.2). Where should such reflex arc\nconnections be made between the input nerve and the output nerve?\nThe best place, of course, would be at the point where they first meet\neach other . Nerves fr om all over the body meet in a bundle in the spinal\ncord on their way to the brain. Reflex arcs are formed in this spinal cord\nitself, although the information input also goes on to reach the brain.\nOf course, reflex arcs have evolved in animals because the thinking\nprocess of the brain is not fast enough.  In fact many animals have very\nlittle or none of the complex neuron network needed for thinking. So it is\nquite likely that reflex arcs have evolved as efficient ways of functioning\nin the absence of true thought pr ocesses.  However , even after complex\nneuron networks have come into existence, reflex arcs continue to be\nmore efficient for quick responses.\n2024-25\n\n\nSource: chapter_6.pdf (Page 1)\nContent: Science 100Control and\nCoordination6 CHAPTER\nIn the pr evious chapter , we looked at life pr ocesses involved in the\nmaintenance functions in living organisms. There, we had started with\na notion we all have, that if we see something moving, it is alive. Some of\nthese movements are in fact the result of growth, as in plants. A seed\ngerminates and grows, and we can see that the seedling moves over the\ncourse of a few days, it pushes soil aside and comes out. But if its growth\nwere to be stopped, these movements would not happen. Some\nmovements, as in many animals and some plants, are not connected\nwith growth. A cat running, children playing on swings, buffaloes\nchewing cud – these are not movements caused by growth.\nWhy do we associate such visible movements with life? A possible\nanswer is that we think of movement as a response to a change in the\nenvironment of the organism. The cat may be running because it has\nseen a mouse.  Not only that, we also think of movement as an attempt\nby living organisms to use changes in their environment to their\nadvantage. Plants grow out into the sunshine. Children try to get pleasure\nand fun out of swinging. Buffaloes chew cud to help break up tough\nfood so as to be able to digest it better . When bright light is focussed on\nour eyes or when we touch a hot object, we detect the change and respond\nto it with movement in order to protect ourselves.\nIf we think a bit more about this, it becomes apparent that all this\nmovement, in response to the environment, is carefully controlled. Each\nkind of a change in the environment evokes an appropriate movement\nin response. When we want to talk to our friends in class, we whisper ,\nrather than shouting loudly. Clearly, the movement to be made depends\non the event that is triggering it. Therefore, such controlled movement\nmust be connected to the recognition of various events in the\nenvironment, followed by only the correct movement in response. In other\nwords, living organisms must use systems providing control and\ncoordination. In keeping with the general principles of body organisation\nin multicellular organisms, specialised tissues are used to provide these\ncontrol and coordination activities.\n6.1\n6.16.1 6.16.1ANIMALS – NERVOUS SYSTEMANIMALS – NERVOUS SYSTEMANIMALS – NERVOUS SYSTEMANIMALS – NERVOUS SYSTEMANIMALS – NERVOUS SYSTEM\nIn animals, such control and coordination are provided by nervous and\nmuscular tissues, which we have studied  in Class IX.

Obviously not, since\nwe know that we are thinking beings. Spinal cord is made up of nerves\nwhich supply information to think about. Thinking involves more\ncomplex mechanisms and neural connections. These are concentrated\nin the brain, which is the main coordinating centre of the body.  The\nbrain and spinal cord constitute the central nervous system (Fig. 6.3).\nThey receive information from all parts of the body and integrate it.\nWe also think about our actions. W riting, talking, moving a chair ,\nclapping at the end of a programme are examples of voluntary actions\nwhich are based on deciding what to do next.  So, the brain also has to\nsend messages to muscles.  This is the second way in which the nervous\nsystem communicates with the muscles.  The communication between\nthe central nervous system and the other parts of the body is facilitated\nby the peripheral nervous system consisting of cranial nerves arising\nfrom the brain and spinal nerves arising from the spinal cord. The brain\nthus allows us to think and take actions based on that thinking.  As you\nwill expect, this is accomplished through a complex design, with different\nparts of the brain responsible for integrating different inputs and outputs.\nThe brain has three such major parts or regions, namely the fore-brain,\nmid-brain and hind-brain.\nThe fore-brain is the main thinking part of the brain. It has regions\nwhich receive sensory impulses from various receptors. Separate areas\nof the fore-brain are specialised for hearing, smell, sight and so on.  There\nare separate areas of association where this sensory information is\ninterpreted by putting it together with information from other receptors\nas well as with information that is already stored in the brain.

For this, the body is designed\nso that the brain sits inside a bony box. Inside the box, the brain is\ncontained in a fluid-filled balloon which provides further shock\nabsorption. If you run your hand down the middle of your back, you\nwill feel a hard, bumpy structure. This is the vertebral column or\nbackbone which protects the spinal cord.\n6.1.4 How does the Nervous Tissue cause Action?\nSo far , we have been talking about nervous tissue, and how it collects\ninformation, sends it around the body, processes information, makes\ndecisions based on information, and conveys decisions to muscles for\naction. In other words, when the action or movement is to be performed,\nmuscle tissue will do the final job. How do animal muscles move? When\na nerve impulse reaches the muscle, the muscle fibre must move. How\ndoes a muscle cell move? The simplest notion of movement at the cellular\nlevel is that muscle cells will move by changing their shape so that they\nshorten. So the next question is, how do muscle cells change their shape?\nThe answer must lie in the chemistry of cellular components. Muscle\ncells have special proteins that change both their shape and their\narrangement in the cell in response to nervous electrical impulses. When\nthis happens, new arrangements of these proteins give the muscle cells\na shorter form. Remember when we talked about muscle tissue in\nClass IX, there were different kinds of muscles, such as voluntary muscles\nand involuntary muscles. Based on what we have discussed so far , what\ndo you think the differences between these would be?\nQUESTIONS\n?1. What is the difference between a reflex action and walking?\n2. What happens at the synapse between two neurons?\n3. Which part of the brain maintains posture and equilibrium of the body?\n4. How do we detect the smell of an agarbatti (incense stick)?\n5. What is the role of the brain in reflex action?\n6.2 COORDINA6.2 COORDINA6.2 COORDINA6.2 COORDINA6.2 COORDINA TION IN PLTION IN PLTION IN PLTION IN PLTION IN PL ANTSANTSANTS\nANTSANTS\nAnimals have a nervous system for controlling and coordinating the\nactivities of the body. But plants have neither a nervous system nor\nmuscles. So, how do they respond to stimuli? When we touch the leaves\nof a chhui-mui  (the ‘sensitive’ or ‘touch-me-not’ plant of the Mimosa\nfamily), they begin to fold up and droop. When a seed germinates, the\nroot goes down, the stem comes up into the air . What happens? Firstly,\nthe leaves of the sensitive plant move very quickly in response to touch.\n2024-25\n\n\nSource: chapter_6.pdf (Page 2)\nContent: Control and Coordination 101object is an urgent and dangerous\nsituation for us. W e need to detect it,\nand respond to it. How do we detect that\nwe are touching a hot object? All\ninformation from our environment is\ndetected by the specialised tips of some\nnerve cells. These receptors are usually\nlocated in our sense organs, such as the\ninner ear , the nose, the tongue, and so\non. So gustatory receptors will detect taste\nwhile olfactory receptors will detect smell.\nThis information, acquired at the\nend of the dendritic tip of a nerve cell\n[Fig. 6.1 (a)],  sets off a chemical reaction\nthat creates an electrical impulse. This\nimpulse travels from the dendrite to the\ncell body, and then along the axon to its\nend. At the end of the axon, the electrical\nimpulse sets off the release of some\nchemicals. These chemicals cross the\ngap, or synapse, and start a similar\nelectrical impulse in a dendrite of the next\nneuron. This is a general scheme of how\nnervous impulses travel in the body. A\nsimilar synapse finally allows delivery of such impulses from neurons to\nother cells, such as muscles cells or gland  [Fig. 6.1 (b)].\nIt is thus no surprise that nervous tissue is made up of an organised\nnetwork of nerve cells or neurons, and is specialised for conducting\ninformation via electrical impulses fr om one part of the body to another .\nLook at Fig. 6.1 (a) and identify the parts of a neuron (i) where\ninformation is acquired, (ii) through which information travels as an\nelectrical impulse, and (iii) where this impulse must be converted into a\nchemical signal for onward transmi ssion.\nActivity 6.1Activity 6.1Activity 6.1Activity 6.1Activity 6.1\n/square6Put some sugar in your mouth.

If so, why might this be happening? Read and talk about\npossible explanations for these kinds of differences. Do you come across\na similar situation when you have a cold?\nFigure 6.1 Figure 6.1 Figure 6.1 Figure 6.1 Figure 6.1 (a) Structure of neuron, (b)      Neuromuscular\njunction(a)\n(b)\n2024-25\n\n\nSource: chapter_6.pdf (Page 3)\nContent: Science 1026.1.1 What happens in Reflex Actions?\n‘Reflex’ is a word we use very commonly when we talk about some sudden\naction in r esponse to something in the envir onment. W e say ‘I jumped\nout of the way of the bus reflexly’, or ‘I pulled my hand back from the\nflame reflexly’, or ‘I was so hungry my mouth started watering reflexly’.\nWhat exactly do we mean? A common idea in all such examples is that\nwe do something without thinking about it, or without feeling in control\nof our r eactions. Y et these ar e situations wher e we ar e responding with\nsome action to changes in our environment. How is control and\ncoordination achieved in such situations?\nLet us consider this further . Take one of our examples. T\nouching a\nflame is an urgent and dangerous situation for us, or in fact, for any\nanimal! How would we respond to this? One seemingly simple way is to\nthink consciously about the pain and the possibility of getting burnt,\nand therefore move our hand. An important question then is, how long\nwill it take us to think all this? The answer depends on how we think.  If\nnerve impulses ar e sent ar ound the way we have talked about earlier ,\nthen thinking is also likely to involve the creation of such impulses.\nThinking is a complex activity, so it is bound to involve a complicated\ninteraction of many nerve impulses from many neurons.\nIf this is the case, it is no surprise that the thinking tissue in our\nbody consists of dense networks of intricately arranged neurons. It sits\nin the forward end of the skull, and receives signals from all over the\nbody which it thinks about before responding to them. Obviously, in\norder to receive these signals, this thinking part of the brain in the skull\nmust be connected to nerves coming from various parts of the body.\nSimilarly, if this part of the brain is to instruct muscles to move, nerves\nmust carry this signal back to different parts of the body. If all of this is\nto be done when we touch a hot object, it may take enough time for us to\nget burnt!\nHow does the design of the body solve this problem? Rather than\nhaving to think about the sensation of heat, if the nerves that detect heat\nwere to be connected to the nerves that move muscles in a simpler way,\nthe process of detecting the signal or the input and responding to it by\nan output action might be completed quickly. Such a connection is\ncommonly called a reflex arc (Fig. 6.2). Where should such reflex arc\nconnections be made between the input nerve and the output nerve?\nThe best place, of course, would be at the point where they first meet\neach other . Nerves fr om all over the body meet in a bundle in the spinal\ncord on their way to the brain. Reflex arcs are formed in this spinal cord\nitself, although the information input also goes on to reach the brain.\nOf course, reflex arcs have evolved in animals because the thinking\nprocess of the brain is not fast enough.  In fact many animals have very\nlittle or none of the complex neuron network needed for thinking. So it is\nquite likely that reflex arcs have evolved as efficient ways of functioning\nin the absence of true thought pr ocesses.  However , even after complex\nneuron networks have come into existence, reflex arcs continue to be\nmore efficient for quick responses.\n2024-25\n\n\nSource: chapter_6.pdf (Page 1)\nContent: Science 100Control and\nCoordination6 CHAPTER\nIn the pr evious chapter , we looked at life pr ocesses involved in the\nmaintenance functions in living organisms. There, we had started with\na notion we all have, that if we see something moving, it is alive. Some of\nthese movements are in fact the result of growth, as in plants. A seed\ngerminates and grows, and we can see that the seedling moves over the\ncourse of a few days, it pushes soil aside and comes out. But if its growth\nwere to be stopped, these movements would not happen. Some\nmovements, as in many animals and some plants, are not connected\nwith growth. A cat running, children playing on swings, buffaloes\nchewing cud – these are not movements caused by growth.\nWhy do we associate such visible movements with life? A possible\nanswer is that we think of movement as a response to a change in the\nenvironment of the organism. The cat may be running because it has\nseen a mouse.  Not only that, we also think of movement as an attempt\nby living organisms to use changes in their environment to their\nadvantage. Plants grow out into the sunshine. Children try to get pleasure\nand fun out of swinging. Buffaloes chew cud to help break up tough\nfood so as to be able to digest it better .
